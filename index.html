        <h1 align="center">AN INTRODUCTION TO SPACE:</h1>
        <IMG src="intro.jpg">
        <p>Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of
            continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by
            astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic probes
            and
            human spaceflight.

            While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was
            the
            development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the early 20th century that allowed physical
            space
            exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific
            research,
            uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic
            advantages against other countries.

            Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold
            War.
            The early era of space exploration was driven by a “Space Race” between the Soviet Union and the United
            States,
            the launch of the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the USSR’s Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the
            first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this
            initial
            period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in
            orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by
            Aleksei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the
            launch
            of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.

            After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as
            the
            Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).

            With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by
            the
            USA remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged
            inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. The Obama Administration
            proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed
            missions
            beyond low earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the
            development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to
            enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth/Moon L1, the Moon, Earth/Sun L2, near-earth asteroids, and
            Phobos
            or Mars orbit. As of March 2011, the US Senate and House of Representatives are still working towards a
            compromise NASA funding bill, which will probably terminate Constellation and fund development of a heavy
            lift
            launch vehicle (HLLV).

            In the 2000s, the People’s Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program, while the
            European Union, Japan, and India have also planned future manned space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and
            India
            have advocated manned missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated
            manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 21st century.

            space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific
            research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and
            developing
            military and strategic advantages against other countries.[2]

            From the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting space tourism and then public space exploration of
            the
            Moon</P>

            Featured snippet from the web
            A telescope is an instrument that is used to view distant objects. If you want to look at the planets, you
            can
            use a telescope. The higher the magnification on the telescope, the better your view will be. </P>
